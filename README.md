^^^ Not sure this belongs here but... I wanna have this written down somewhere
and this seems good enough for right this second.

* We support the following metadata in your `_data.json`, use it!
   * `title` - Short and descriptive, bonus points for terminology that somebody
   would search for.
   * `description` - One to two sentences about this page. May be used in google
   search results or when a page is shared in slack/social media.
